.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gdl
is an incremental compiler for the GNU Data Language (GDL).  GDL is
being developed with the aim of providing an open\-source drop\-in
replacement for ITTVIS Interactive Data Language (IDL). It is also
partially compatible with Visual Numerics (VN) PV\-WAVE. IDL and
PV\-WAVE are registered trademarks of ITTVIS and VN, respectively.  GDL
and its library routines are designed as a tool for numerical data
analysis and visualisation.  GDL is dynamically typed, vectorized and
has object\-oriented programming capabilities.  The library routines
handle numerical calculations, data visualisation, signal/image
processing, file input/output (incl. graphical and scientific data
formats such as TIFF, PNG, netCDF, HDF etc) and interaction with host
OS.

Information on GDL/IDL/PV\-WAVE syntax and library routines can be
found in e.g.:

\- GDL documentation draft at: http://gnudatalanguage.sf.net/gdl.pdf

\- IDL manual on\-line @ NASA.gov:

A vast part of GDL library routines is implemented using open\-source
libraries including GSL, plPlot, and optionally: readline, FFTW, Eigen3,
ImageMagick, netCDF, HDF4, HDF5, libproj4, UDUNITS\-2, libps and
others.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-help (or \-h)
Show summary of options
.TP
.B \-\-version (or \-v, \-V)
Show version of program
.TP
.B \-\-quiet (or \-quiet, \-q)
Suppress welcome messages
.TP
.B \-arg value
Tells COMMAND_LINE_ARGS() to report the following argument (may be
specified more than once)
.TP
.B \-args ...
Tells COMMAND_LINE_ARGS() to report all following arguments
.TP
.B \-e statement
Execute given statement and exit (last occurrence taken into account
only, executed after startup file, may not be specified together with
batch files)
.TP
.B \-pref=/path/to/PreferenceFile
(only partially working now) setting using external text file few
variables including default preferences (e.g. X11 Windows Size)
.TP
.B \-\-fakerelease version
setting !VERSION.RELASE to that value. !VERSION.RELASE is often tested by
procedures to decide whether some function or option should be used. It is
sometimes possible to use this option to fool a procedure that request a
specific value of !VERSION.RELEASE
.TP
.B \-\-fussy
signals that all used procedures will adhere with modern IDL, 
where "()" are for functions and "[]" are for arrays.
This speeds up (sometimes terribly) compilation but choke on every use of "()" with arrays.
Conversion of procedures to modern IDL can be done with D. Landsman's idlv4_to_v5 procedure.
Use enviromnment variable "GDL_IS_FUSSY" to set up permanently this feature.
.TP
.B \-\-sloppy
inverse of fussy above.
Sets the traditional (default) compiling option where "()"  can be used both with functions and arrays.
Needed to counteract temporarily the effect of the enviromnment variable "GDL_IS_FUSSY".
.TP
.B \-\-use-wx
Tells GDL to use WxWidgets graphics instead of X11 or Windows. (nicer plots).
Also enabled by setting the environment variable GDL_USE_WX to a non-null value.
.TP
.B \-\-no-use-wx
Tells GDL no to use WxWidgets graphics, even if env. var. "GDL_USE_WX" is set.
.TP
.B \-\-no-dSFMT
Tells GDL not to use double precision SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne Twister(dSFMT) for random doubles.
Also disabled by setting the environment variable GDL_NO_DSFMT to a non-null value.


The \-demo, \-em, \-novm, \-queue, \-rt, \-ulicense and \-vm options
are ignored for compatibility with IDL.
.TP
A list of batch files to be executed before entering the interactive
mode (but after executing a startup file, if specified) may be given
when not using the \-e option.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B $DATADIR/gnudatalanguage/lib/*.pro
Library routines implemented in GDL. $DATADIR is specified during
compilation and usually translates to /usr/share, /usr/local/share or
alike. GDL includes this directory in its search path unless GDL_PATH
or IDL_PATH env. variables are set (see below).
.TP
.B $HOME/.gdl/history
A file used for storing the history of commands issued in the
interactive mode
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables have special meaning to
.BR gdl .
The
.B GDL_*
variant, if defined, takes precedence over any corresponding
.B IDL_*
variant.
.TP
.B GDL_PATH, IDL_PATH
The GDL command (script) search path.
.TP
.B GDL_STARTUP, IDL_STARTUP
A file of commands to be executed on startup.
.TP
.B GDL_TMPDIR, IDL_TMPDIR
A directory in which temporary files may be created.
.TP
.B HOME, SHELL
Variables influencing shell invocations from within GDL (SPAWN
procedure and the $ interpreter command).  Value of HOME determines as
well the location of the GDL history\-file.
.TP
.B PATH
Determines search path when spawning child processes using the SPAWN
procedure with the /NOSHELL keyword set.
.TP
.B PYTHONPATH
Influences behaviour of PYTHON procedure and PYTHON() function
(available if GDL is compiled with support for calling Python code)
.TP
.B GDL_MPI
A message to be sent out using MPI_Send before initialization of the
interpreter (available if GDL is compiled with support for MPI)
.TP
.B DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT
Tell GDL how to connect to the X server
.TP
.B PLPLOT_DRV_DIR
Override the default location of PLplot dynamic drivers.
.TP
.B LC_*
The locale\-related settings accessible via LOCALE_GET() (GDL always
uses the C locale internally)
.TP
.B GDL_GR_WIN_HEIGHT
Sets the preference for the default height of a Windows(tm) graphic window
.TP
.B GDL_GR_WIN_QSCREEN
if set to true (1) this will prevent the use of the GDL_GR_WIN_HEIGHT and GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH preferences and the default dimensions of graphic windows will be 1/4 of the screen dimensions
.TP
.B GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH
Sets the preference for the default width of a Windows(tm) graphic window
.TP
.B GDL_GR_X_HEIGHT
Sets the preference for the default height of an X11 graphic window
.TP
.B GDL_GR_X_QSCREEN
if set to true (1) this will prevent the use of the GDL_GR_X_HEIGHT and GDL_GR_X_WIDTH preferences and the default dimensions of graphic windows will be 1/4 of the screen dimensions
.TP
.B GDL_GR_X_WIDTH
Sets the preference for the default width of an X11 graphic window
.TP
.B GDL_WX_BACKEND
can be set to [0,1,2] which will select, respectively, the backends 0,1 or 2 of plplot's old wxWidgets driver (plplot versions < 5.10). Backend 2 has antialiasing enabled.
.TP
.B GDL_MAPS_DIR
If not automatically found, tells GDL where the maps files (coasts rivers, etc, used by MAPS_CONTINENTS) are located. 
These are in Shapefile format and newer versions can possibly be present on naturalearthdata.com
