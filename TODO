-- a ToDo list of missing commands
-- a ToDo list related to system variables
-- a ToDo list of missing Functions and Procedures
-- a ToDo list of incomplete Functions and Procedures, missing keywords and
    limited/buggy functionnalities in existing func/pro


ToDo list of missing commands (not exhaustive, most requested)

.rnew
.skip
.reset_session


ToDo list related to system variables


!ERROR, !ERR and !ERROR_STATE are not properly set by all library
  functions

!EDIT_INPUT, preferences IDL_EDIT_INPUT, IDL_RBUF_PERSIST and IDL_RBUF_SIZE.


ToDo list of Functions and Procedures


* WMENU function
Category: user interface
Langage: GDL, later may be in C++ with widgets !
Difficulty: easy
Contact: Alain
Comments: undocumented feature coming from the old IDL versions
(before 4.0). A draft exists, substiting the X11 interface by
a console one.


ToDo list of incomplete Function/Procedure, missing keywords ...


* ON_ERROR and CATCH procedures
Category: system
Langage: C++
Difficulty: unknow
Contact: Marc
Comments: ON_ERROR and CATCH are not fully implemented (GDL recognizes them,
but does not perform any action, ie. in case of error, the data is not used).

* HELP
Category: system
Langage: C++
Difficulty: unknow
Contact:
Comments: some useful keywords are not handle

* PLOT, OPLOT, PLOTS, CONTOUR, SURFACE, AXIS, XYOUTS
Category: display
Langage: C++
Difficulty: parts are obvious, other may be impossible with plplot lib!
Contact: Alain
Comments: some useful keywords are not handle

* USERSYM
Category: display
Langage: C++ (linked to plplot library
Difficulty: may be impossible with plplot lib!
Contact: Joel or Alain
Comments: 

* BESELI/BESELJ/BESELK
Category: numeric
Langage: C++ (in math_fun_ac.cpp)
Difficulty: unknow.
Contact: Alain
Comments: some details need to be fix when the arrays
are not commensurable. It is highly probable that other
functions do suffer from the same problems. Some have been
corrected (the GAMMA/BETA family)

* TVRD : keyword !order
Category: display
Langage: C++ (in devicex.hpp)
Difficulty: unknow.
Contact: Alain
Comments: to be complete for !order keyword (managed in TV).
A priori, the method p->Rotate(7) cannot be used on Byte arrays.

* INVERT function : some exceptions
Category: numeric
Langage: C++ (in gsl_fun.cpp)
Difficulty: easy.
Contact: Alain
Comments: managning the last exceptions (input size,
no-square matrix, string conversion should work).
Very easy but could be time consuming if extensive tests.
See currents tests in testsuite/test_invert_matrix.pro

* MEDIAN, parameter "width"
Category: numeric
Langage: C++
Difficulty: very difficult
Contact: Alain
Comments: codes in C/C++ in public domain or under GPL available,
"interfaces" missing. Please make biblio before writing it, it
is not obvious. Availability/efficienty of algo depend on data type !!
It is better to implement it in C/C++ because it is computer intensif.

* SPLINE serie (SPL_INIT, SPL_INTERP)
Category: numeric
Langage: C++ 
Difficulty: existing algo in NR, not under GPL.
Contact: Alain
Comments: different personns have asked for that.
A working version --but slow-- in GDL syntax does exists, contact me
for the real person who code that.
It is better to implement it in C/C++ because it is computer intensif

* LA_ serie (based on the LAPACK routines)
Category: numeric
Langage: a priori C++
Difficulty: some existing algo, not under GPL ??
Contact: 
Comments: different personns have asked ...
