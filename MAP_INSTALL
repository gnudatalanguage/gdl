Revised version by Gilles Duvert on July 2014
Small revision by Alain on Jan. 2019 (mostly GSHHS --> GSHHG)
Removed gshhs[g] stuff now that IDLffShape works. (GD)

To provide map projections support your first need to make sure the
proj.4 library is installed. There are two libraries, the 'classic
PROJ.4' library maintained by the original author, G. Evenden:
http://home.comcast.net/~gevenden56/proj/
(http://home.comcast.net/~gevenden56/proj/libproj4.3_20081120.tar.bz2)
and a fork of this library available at http://trac.osgeo.org/proj.

Both work with GDL and provide all projection-related internal
facilities.  We tend to prefer G. Evenden's trimmed classical version
since it handles correctly rotations and has fever
crashes. Unfortunately the fancy interrupted Goode Homolosine is not
present in GE's library.  It is recommendend to recompile either of
these libraries instead of using the version that may come with your
software distribution (but it can work, too).

If GDL does not find (lib)proj4 files automatically, use 
"-DLIBPROJ4=YES" "-DLIBPROJ4DIR=DIR" as arguments for cmake. 
(were 'DIR' is the location of the compiled library.

To finish the support of projections in GDL, first the following
additional PRO files must be acquired and placed in a directory of the
GDL PATH:

http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_grid.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_horizon.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_image.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_patch.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_point_valid.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_image.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_info.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_init_commonblock.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_init_common.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_init.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_satellite_limit.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_set.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_struct_append.pro
(cd src/pro/ ; mkdir map; cd map; grep 'gsfc.nasa' ../../../MAP* | xargs wget)

Note that 'map_continents.pro' is not in this list. map_continents is
inside GDL.  If these .pro files are not available, google is your
friend;^).  These are proprietary files and not part of the GDL
distribution.  They do lots of complicated things in a
not-very-general way, and should be rewritten completely for GDL. As
GDL uses Proj.4 and Proj know all the tricks used in these procedures,
it should not be such a terrible job. Help would be most
appreciated. See below for an example where new projections are used
that do not need the above procedures...

===========================================================================

MAP_CONTINENTS is now implemented in GDL using the Natural Earth 
(http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) shapefiles and our new support for reading
the ESRI Shapefile format in which one can find any number of geospatial informations.
Since we added support for IDLffShape (meaning IDL f[ile] f[ormat] Shape[file] tool)
one can now use toold like coyote's http://www.idlcoyote.com/idldoc/maps/cgdrawshapes.html
to do more useful work than just MAP_CONTINENTS.

The necessary shapefiles for MAP_CONTINENTS are now shipped with GDL,
but the user may use a more recent version  by setting the variable
!GEOSPATIAL_DATA_DIR directly such as
GDL> !GEOSPATIAL_DATA_DIR="/a/path/to/the/data" ;  (absolute or relative)

The FILLing of MAP_CONTINENTS is erratical. Help welcome.

===========================================================================
NOTE ON PROJECTION-RELATED PROCEDURES IN GDL (and IDL)
===========================================================================

All the historical projections are supported fully (Godde's Homolosine
will not be truncated if you link with G.Evenden's library).  The GCTP
supplementary projections are at least partially supported. They lack
the proper initialisation of the map.pipeline array, which governs the
clipping and avoids spurious lines.  Moreover, ALL the projections in
the PROJ.4 library linked with GDL are supported via a trick: passing
a valid PROJ.4 command line in the projection name of a map structure,
with the projection number set to 999

example:
;given lon and lat, a table of "test" longitudes and latitudes:
a=!map
a.up_name="+proj=mbtfpq +a=1"
a.projection=999
map_clip_set,/TRANSFORM,map=a
b=map_proj_forward(lon, lat,map=a)
a.uv_box=[min(b(0,*)),min(b(1,*)),max(b(0,*)),max(b(1,*))];
plot, a.uv_box[[0,2]],a.uv_box[[1,3]],/NODATA, /ISOTROPIC, XSTYLE=1, YSTYLE=1
map_continents,map=a
map_grid,map=a

Some warnings:
- MAP_SET is straightforward to use but is restricted to historical
  projections.
- MAP_PROJ_INIT is very long to compile (GDL bug!) but gives access to
all projections.  However some projections may crash with
MAP_PROJ_INIT since proj.4 is not protected at all (against null
pointers, unknown projection inverses, etc...). We recommend
G.Ewenden's library which is not so "good programmer practice" but has
more "good sense"!

PS (by AC): a demo ("test_map.pro") is now available in the testsuite/
