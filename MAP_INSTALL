Revised version by Gilles Duvert on July 2014

To provide map projections support your first need to make sure the
proj.4 library is installed. There are two libraries, the 'classic
PROJ.4' library maintained by the original author, G. Evenden:
http://home.comcast.net/~gevenden56/proj/
(http://home.comcast.net/~gevenden56/proj/libproj4.3_20081120.tar.bz2)
and a more complete (but by no means bug free!) fork of this library
available at http://trac.osgeo.org/proj.

Both work with GDL and provide all projection-related internal
facilities.  We tend to prefer G. Evenden's trimmed classical version
since it handles correctly rotations and has fever
crashes. Unfortunately the fancy interrupted Goode Homomsine is not
present in GE's library.  It is recommendend to recompile either of
these libraries instead of using the version that may come with your
software distribution (but it can work, too).

If GDL does not find (lib)proj4 files automatically, use 
"-DLIBPROJ4=YES" "-DLIBPROJ4DIR=DIR" as arguments for cmake. 
(were 'DIR' is the location of the compiled library.

To finish the support of projections in GDL, first the following
additional PRO files must be acquired and placed in a directory of the
GDL PATH:

http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_grid.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_horizon.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_image.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_patch.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_point_valid.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_image.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_info.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_init_commonblock.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_init_common.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_proj_init.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_set.pro
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/exelislib/map_struct_append.pro

Note that 'map_continents.pro' is not in this list. map_continents is
inside GDL.  If these .pro files are not available, google is your
friend;^).  These are proprietary files and not part of the GDL
distribution.  They do lots of complicated things in a
not-very-general way, and should be rewritten completely for GDL. As
GDL uses Proj.4 and Proj know all the tricks used in these procedures,
it should not be such a terrible job. Help would be most
appreciated. See below for an example where new projections are used
that do not need the above procedures...

===========================================================================

MAP_CONTINENTS is implemented in GDL using the GSHHSG (Global 
Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database) 
available under the GNU GPL. To provide support for MAP_CONTINENTS the 
database files and one header file (gshhs.h) need to be downloaded e.g. from:

ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhsg

see file ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/README.TXT for
complete description.

The header file for the 2.0 dataset is in the gshhs_1.12_src.zip file.
The datafiles (*.b) are in the gshhs_2.0.tbz file.

When compiling GDL, the "-DGSHHS=YES" option must be given (not
enabled by default), optionally with an argument pointing to the GSHHS
installation prefix: -DGSHHSDIR="DIR"
 
Warning: At execution time, GDL will look for the GSHHS datafiles
(gshhs_f.b, gshhs_l.b, etc...) in the $GSHHS_DATA_DIR. Before running
GDL you can setup this variable (e.g. in bash : 
export GSHHS_DATA_DIR=/my/path/to/gshhs/). 
When GDL is compiled, if $GSHHS_DATA_DIR unknown, if $GDLDATADIR
exists and if $GDLDATADIR/../gshhs/ exist too, this path is used as a
defaut directory for gshhs data. So the files can/must be put there. 
(we need a more flexible solution - FIXME!)

NOTE ON PROJECTION-RELATED PROCEDURES IN GDL (and IDL)
===========================================================================

All the historical projections are supported fully (Godde's Homolosine
will not be truncated if you link with G.Evenden's library).  The GCTP
supplementary projections are at least partially supported. They lack
the proper initialisation of the map.pipeline array, which governs the
clipping and avoids spurious lines.  Moreover, ALL the projections in
the PROJ.4 library linked with GDL are supported via a trick: passing
a valid PROJ.4 command line in the projection name of a map structure,
with the projection number set to 999

example:
a=!map
a.up_name="+proj=mbtfpq +a=1"
a.projection=999
map_clip_set,/TRANSFORM,map=a
b=map_proj_forward(lon, lat,map=a)
a.uv_box=[min(b(0,*)),min(b(1,*)),max(b(0,*)),max(b(1,*))];
(lon and lat being a table of "test" longitudes and latitudes)
plot, a.uv_box[[0,2]],a.uv_box[[1,3]],/NODATA, /ISOTROPIC, XSTYLE=1, YSTYLE=1
map_continents,map=a
map_grid,map=a

Some warnings:
- MAP_SET is straightforward to use but is restricted to historical
  projections.
- MAP_PROJ_INIT is very long to compile (GDL bug!) but gives access to
all projections.  However some projections may crash with
MAP_PROJ_INIT since proj.4 is not protected at all (against null
pointers, unknown projection inverses, etc...). We recommend
G.Ewenden's library which is not so "good programmer practice" but has
more "good sense"!
