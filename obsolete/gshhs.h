 *	14-SEP-2004.  PW: Version 1.3.  Header is now n * 8 bytes (n = 5)
 *			  For use with version 1.3 of GSHHS
 *	2-MAY-2006.  PW: Version 1.4.  Header is now 32 bytes (all int 4)
 *			  For use with version 1.4 of GSHHS
 *	31-MAR-2007.  PW: Version 1.5.  no format change
 *			  For use with version 1.5 of GSHHS
 *	28-AUG-2007.  PW: Version 1.6.  no format change
 *			  For use with version 1.6 of GSHHS which now has WDBII
 *			  borders and rivers.
 *	03-JUL-2008.  PW: Version 1.11. New -I<id> option to pull out a single pol
 *	27-MAY-2009.  PW: Version 1.12. Now includes container polygon ID in header,
 *			  an ancestor ID, and area of the reduced polygon. Works on
 *			  GSHHS 2.0 data.
 *			  Header is now 44 bytes (all 4-byte integers)
 *	24-MAY-2010.  PW: Data version is now 2.1.0. [no change to format]
 *	15-JUL-2011.  PW: Data version is now 2.2.0. [Change in header format to store
 *			  area magnitude and let greenwich be 2-bit flag (0-3)]. Also
 *			  flag WDBII riverlakes with the river flag as used for GSHHS.
