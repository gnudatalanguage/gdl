Script made by SI LOUNIS AMAR (https://github.com/SIAMAR) with the help of SFLINOIS (https://github.com/SFLINOIS)

This script is not an official build of GDL on Windows
Its purpose is only to help you with the GDL build
Any feedback about the script is greatly appreciated ! :)

For this build to work, you need :

-7zip (We use 7zip to unpack the libraries we download, you can always modify the script to use another software to unpack)
-LIBS.zip (wich contain some libraries that we were not able to compile in the script)
-wget.zip (wich we use do download all the libraries we need in order to compile GDL)
-gdl.bat (The script used to launch GDL once compiled)

The gdl executable is located in .\build\gdl\bin (Please use gdl.bat to launch gdl with correct paths)

You can find the script here : http://aramis.obspm.fr/~coulais/GDL/GDL4MSwin/gdl-minimalscript-win/
