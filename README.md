GDL - GNU Data Language
=======================

GDL is a free/libre/open source incremental compiler compatible with IDL (Interactive Data Language) and to some extent with PV-WAVE. 
Together with its library routines it serves as a tool for data analysis and visualization in such disciplines 
as astronomy, geosciences and medical imaging. 
GDL development had been started by **Marc Schellens** back in early noughties and has since continued 
with help of a team of maintainers, developers, packagers and thanks to feedback from users.

IDL is a registered trademark of [Harris Geospatial Solutions](https://www.harrisgeospatial.com).
PV-WAVE is a product of [Rogue Wave Software](https://www.roguewave.com).

Overview
--------

GDL is a domain-specific programming language and a data analysis environment.
As a language, it is dynamically-typed, array-oriented, vectorised and has 
object-oriented programming capabilities. 
GDL library routines handle numerical calculations, data visualisation, signal/image processing, 
interaction with host OS and data input/output. 
GDL supports several data formats such as netCDF, HDF4, HDF5, GRIB, PNG, TIFF, DICOM, etc. 
Graphical output is handled by X11, PostScript, SVG or z-buffer terminals, the last one allowing 
output graphics (plots) to be saved in a variety of raster graphics formats. 
GDL features integrated debugging facilities. 
The built-in widget functionality enables development of GUI-based software.
GDL has also a Python bridge (Python code can be called from GDL; GDL can be compiled as a Python module). 
Development and maintenance of GDL is carried out targeting Linux, BSD, OSX and Windows (MinGW, Cygwin).

GDL is invoked just by typing `gdl` but see `gdl -h` as it has a number of commandline options.
GDL may be known as `gnudl` or `gnudatalanguage` on some operating systems.

Other open-source numerical data analysis tools similar to GDL include
[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/),
[GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/),
[Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/),
[PDL](http://pdl.perl.org/),
[NCL](http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/),
[R](http://www.r-project.org/),
[Yorick](http://yorick.sourceforge.net/).

Dependencies 
-------------------------------------

Packaged versions of GDL are available for several Linux distributions, BSD and Mac OS X. 
Please note that several features of GDL depend on compile-time configuration, and might not 
be available in pre-built or pre-configured packages. 

GDL has numerous dependencies, most of the optional but highly recommended if you want it to be areally useful tool.
- [readline](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) mandatory. For easy command line editing, recalling, history. 
- [\[n\]curses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) mandatory. Terminal management.
- [zlib](https://zlib.net/) mandatory. compressed file access.
- [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) mandatory, for many math functions.
- [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/) optional, but speed will suffer if not present
- [Magick++](https://imagemagick.org/) / [GraphicsMagick](http://graphicsmagick.org/) optional, but don't you want to read/write many image formats?
- [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) mandatory unless you do not want graphic outputs and widgets?
- [Xlib/X11](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libx11/) not used unless you explictly ask for it (replaced by wxWidgets for sake of compatibility on Windows, linux and MacOSX. 
- [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) optional, but useful for reading this kind of data.
- [HDF4](https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/)  optional, but useful for reading this kind of data.
- [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)   optional, but useful for reading this kind of data.
- [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) optional, but don't you need a fast fft at times?
- [PROJ](http://proj.org/) optional but forget about mapping capabilities if absent.
- [Shapelib](http://shapelib.maptools.org/) optional but forget about mapping capabilities if absent.
- [Expat](https://libexpat.github.io/) optional but helps implement IDLffXMLSAX parser objects. 
- [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) optional but provides clustering facilities.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)/[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) optional but add python bridge and jupyter notebook.
- [udunits](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) optional, units conversion
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) optional but provides inordiante speed enhancements...
- [ecCodes](https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECC/ecCodes+Home)/[GRIB](https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB) optional, for GRIB API support.
- [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) optional, provides the SIMPLEX command.

Besides, for optimal use (speed mainly), GDL incorporates slightly edited code of
- [dSFMT](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT) as our parallel random Generator.
- [delaunator](https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator) as our new hyperfast triangulation.
- [ANTLR3](https://www.antlr3.org/) as interpretor.
- [Median Filtering](http://nomis80.org/ctmf.html )
- [Median Filtering](http://users.ics.aalto.fi/suomela)
- [Radix Sorting](https://github.com/Pierre-Terdiman/RadixRedux) (we have written all variants up to doubles).

Build-time dependencies
-----------------------

Build and test automation is carried out using [CMake](http://cmake.org/).

GDL interpreter has been developed using [ANTLR v2](http://www.antlr2.org) but unless you want 
to change the grammar (\*.g files) you don't need ANTLR. 
All relevant ANTLR files are included in the source tree.

Support, feedback and contributions
-----------------------------------

Your comments are welcome! Let us know what you use GDL for. Or if you don't, why not. 
Which functionality are you missing/would appreciate most for coming versions. 
Please use the github issue-tracking system to report 
bugs, complaints, suggestions and comments.

Code enhancements in the form of pull requests are very welcome!
Note that contributions can be made in C++, IDL/GDL or Python, as well as
by providing enhancements and extensions of the README files, diagnostic messages, etc.

Among the major challenges GDL development is facing currently, there are:
- [enhancing test coverage](https://codecov.io/github/gnudatalanguage/gdl?branch=master) by writing test programs in GDL
- streamlining development and maintenance of GDL reference docs and examples (using the [Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/idl_kernel)?)
- bringing in into the team the needed know-how to address the [backlog of ANTLR-related issues](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/labels/antlr)
- increasing presence within and interoperability with the Python ecosystem, including adding support for Python 3 (calling GDL from Python 2 and calling Python 2 from GDL is already implemented!)

Help welcome!

Information resources
---------------------

As GDL is aimed as a drop-in replacement for IDL,
resources for IDL constitute valuable sources of information for GDL users as well.
These include:
- the [official IDL documentation](https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/)
- the [idl-pvwave Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/idl-pvwave)
- the [comp.lang.idl-pvwave usenet group archives](http://www.idlcoyote.com/comp.lang.idl-pvwave/) (dating back to 1991!)
- Wikipedia article on [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_\(programming_language\)) and references therein
- websites of IDL gurus including [David Fanning](http://www.idlcoyote.com/) and [Michael Galloy](http://michaelgalloy.com/)
- numerous [tutorials and lecture notes](https://www.google.com/search?q=interactive+data+language) introducing IDL

There are several open source packages compatible or interoperable with GDL, including:
- the [MPFIT](https://pages.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/cmpfit.html) curve fitting library written in IDL (also available as a [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/gdl-mpfit))
- the [IDL Astronomy User's Library](https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/) written in IDL (also available as a [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/gdl-idlastro))
- the [Coyote](https://www.idlcoyote.com) library of IDL-written utilities (also available as a [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/gdl-coyote))
- the [TeXtoIDL](http://physics.mnstate.edu/craig/textoidl/) package 
- the [gdlde](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdlde) IDE
- the [IDL/GDL Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/idl_kernel)
- the [IDLWAVE Emacs mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/idlwave.html)
- IDL [syntax highlighting module for Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/syntax/idlang.vim)
- the [SingleCompile extension for Vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/SingleCompile)

Alain Coulais maintains the [GDL-announces mailing list](https://sympa.obspm.fr/wws/info/gdl-announces).

There have been quite some [mentions of GDL in scientific literature](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q="gnu+data+language") 
which also provide example use cases.
The Coulais et al. papers from the ADASS conferences are the best way to cite GDL as of now.
