	   - FZ_ROOTS: initial import (same way than IMSL_ZEROPOLY using gsl_poly_complex_solve(), only real coefs. for input poly)
	   - FX_ROOT: initial import. in c++
           - keyword DIM in MOMENT(), MEAN(), STDDEV(), VARIANCE(), SKEWNESS(), KURTOSIS() (requested DIM and other improvments)

0.9.4:
           - when compiled with Eigen3 library, significant speed improvement
	     in MATRIX_MULTIPLY() (and # operators), especially on multi-cores
	     Basic loading managment included (if some core are busy).
           - LIST and HASH are fully supported
	     even left-side struct access is possible e. g.: 
	       GDL> h = HASH('key',{tag1:1})  &  h['key'].tag1 = 3
	     this even works with all (derived) GDL_OBJECTs:
	     In this case (a variable set to) !NULL is passed as the OBJREF 
	     parameter to the OBJECT::_OVERLOADBRACKETSLEFTSIDE member procedure,
	     it must in turn set this OBJREF parameter (the variable) to a POINTER to
	     the heap variable to access.
           - .RESET_SESSION and .FULL_RESET_SESSION commands
           - CHOLSOL/CHOLDC using Eigen3 (sub-optimal but efficient for big matrix on multicores) (LA_CHOLSOL/LA_CHOLDC removed for technical issues)
           - large change in various graphic/plotting keywords (see below). 3D options supported, 
             but some limitations due to the use of the plplot library. 
           - PLOT, OPLOT: All keywords supported except FONT and CHANNEL,
	   	Correct handling of log/DATA/NORMAL/DEVICE coordinates and CLIPPING.
           - PSYMs shapes now identical to IDL's.
           - PLOTS: idem as above, all keywords now supported.
           - XYOUTS: idem as above, one-argument support (XYOUTS,"string"). 
	   	Enhancement wrt. reference program: color,size,angle,etc 
	   	of text are vectors. FONT and TEXT_AXES not supported.
           - CONTOUR: Support of all options except CELL_FILL, C_ANNOTATIONS, CLOSED, DOWNHILL,
               IRREGULAR, TRIANGULATION,PATH_***
               Correct implementation of Z, [X,Y], i.e., contours may be skewed,
	       rotated, etc depending on X and Y.
               Better than IDL:
               - a new ZLOG option makes log contours as well.
               - C_ORIENTATION, C_SPACING are also vectors.
               - log axes give better results
               - good contouring of Not-A-Number values in Z and MIN_VALUE/MAX_VALUE
               - CLIPPING ok.
               - Automatic limits in some cases still different from IDL.
           - AXIS and boxes in plots: all [XYZ]TICK[***] options supported except TICKV
	   	and a few TICKFORMAT specifics.
           - CURSOR: full support for CURSOR command, which is interruptible by control-c 
	   	and has all the options.
           - SURFACE: all Keywords supported except "LEGO" and "CHANNEL".
           - Added SHADE_SURF (slow and imperfect shading from the plplot library).
           - Added cursor-related functions TVCRS and command EMPTY. 
           - Added DEVICE options CURSOR_CROSSHAIR, CURSOR_STANDARD, CURSOR_ORIGINAL and 
	   	GET/SET_GRAPHICS_FUNCTION (GXoR, GXand, etc). 
           - Disabled by default the focus in the X11 graphics windows as IDL does and 
	   	repositioned WINDOWS by default to top-right of screen. Screen size and behaviour
                using GDL_GR_X_WIDTH, GDL_GR_Y_WIDTH and GDL_GR_X_QSCREEN environment variables (X window)
                (GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH, GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH and GDL_GR_WIN_QSCREEN under windows)
           - WSHOW works irregularly, depending on the window manager.


0.9.5:
           - lot of improvments in Widgets related code. Available widgets:
	     WIDGET_DRAW(!), WIDGET_BASE, WIDGET_BUTTON, 
             WIDGET_DROPLIST, WIDGET_COMBOBOX, WIDGET_LIST, 
             WIDGET_SLIDER, WIDGET_TAB, WIDGET_TEXT, 
             WIDGET_LABEL, CW_BGROUP
	     (Note: Not all keywords are supported yet (however, they are accepted) but almost all functional keywords.
	     This means: Programs using these widgets should work but maybe look a bit different)
	     Controlling routines:
	     WIDGET_EVENT, WIDGET_CONTROL, XMANAGER
           - TIC and TOC
           - !CONST system variable
           - initial import of NetCDF-4 related codes:
             NCDF_GROUPSINQ, NCDF_GROUPNAME, NCDF_GROUPDEF, NCDF_FULLGROUPNAME,
             NCDF_GROUPPARENT, NCDF_DIMIDSINQ, NCDF_NCIDINQ, NCDF_VARIDSINQ
           - introducing the NULL device type, better result on Unix like system without X11 
             (e. g. computing nodes on HPC)
	   - better free format for print, preserving precision digits.
	   - ISA() and TYPENAME()

0.9.6:
	   - support for projections now complete. See MAP_INSTALL for details.
	   - new keywords (BOOLEAN,INTEGER,FLOAT,COMPLEX,STRING) in ISA()
	   - two new system variables: !TRUE and !FALSE
